# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting in Python üìà

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks dedicated to exploring and applying various time series analysis and forecasting techniques. The projects are based on guided tutorials from different sources, providing a practical and hands-on approach to learning.

The main objectives of this repository are:
- To implement fundamental and advanced forecasting models from scratch and using specialized libraries.
- To understand the theoretical concepts behind time series components like stationarity, seasonality, and autocorrelation.
- To practice a complete data science workflow: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model building, robust evaluation, and visualization.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The projects are organized into two main directories based on their source:

-   `youtube-forecasting-tutorial/`: A comprehensive, in-depth tutorial covering a wide range of modern forecasting techniques using the `statsforecast` library.
-   `book-time-series-forecasting-in-python/`: A series of notebooks based on the "Time Series Forecasting in Python" book, focusing on building foundational concepts step-by-step using `statsmodels`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites & Setup

To run these notebooks, you'll need Python 3 and a few key data science libraries. It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**Key Libraries:**
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsforecast`
- `utilsforecast`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn "statsforecast[models]"
